Paragraphs from the House of Slugs

~

For lack of much better to do, I go for a bike ride around the closest town, hoping to find some new little corners or some leftover memories. I pedal westward and up a small hill to cross some railroad tracks, dairy farms in all directions. The fields are huge, distantly surrounded by thick trees, and flanked above by a flat blue sky. I’m a city boy and to see such enormously open spaces takes my breath away.

On my return the road turns into some woods and packed the sky and pastures into a small, dark space. The same will happen when I fly back to the East coast of the US in a few weeks. I’ll fold the landscape into the back of my head and unfurl it like a map when the height and density and noise and heat are all too much. 

~

When it rains the slugs come out of the ground, through the cracks in the cement and gaps between the stones. They wind their way around the house, masses of greasy, greying flesh. We used to feed them the remainders of cabbage and lettuce when friendly, beer and salt when maleficent, dumping it all out of the window in the kitchen while keeping the door locked tight.

~

All roads near the house are lined on both sides with trees, creating narrow tunnels that burrow between the spaces owned by fields and farm houses at the horizon. I think the trees are oaks and they are mostly of uniform height, likely planted near the same time a couple generations ago. They only get light on one side, as the trees on the opposite side of the road block the sun. Thus branches and leaves only grow on the exterior, allowing the trees to grow tall and arch over the road. As you drive, you feel the sense of a continuous green vaulted ceiling; a cathedral of trees. 

~

On the north end of the yard there is a cluster of extremely wide and tall trees, between which hang laundry lines put up perhaps around when I was born. Just like on the streets, the trees only grow leaves on the outside of this enclosed space. Standing between and looking up feels like standing in the ribcage of an enormous creature. 

~

I call my Oma, an international call so I try to make it fast. She sounds excited to hear my voice, coming from her house on another continent. I need help turning the stove on and I say I don’t think gas is flowing. There is a knob behind the stove, she says, and she calls the knob heavy. I have never used this word to describe a knob before. The actual thing I grab to turn the valve is a cheap plastic cap that I would have called sticky, or perhaps gummy. I hate that it is flimsy plastic yet still so difficult to rotate, and I think again about why she chose the word heavy. I wonder if everything is heavy when you are 85 and I am afraid of being old in a heavy house. 

~

Wind here is gestural and dramatic, sweeping over the flora, brushing leaves over each other, and making branches squeak. The countryside is built of three materials: plant, pavement, and water. Canals turn the fields into grids and are sometimes flanked by smooth roads. When big gusts come rolling over the landscape the fronds at the top of the crop stalks shimmer in waves. The canals catch and carry these solitons far into the distance, and light dances through the foliage onto the pavement. The lungs of the countryside exhale.

~

The surest sign of a still day here in the low countries is two adjacent windmills pointed in different directions.

~

I’m trying to wake up earlier but instead I keep finding excuses to stay up late. If I get up before ten there is a marvelous marbling of light filling the front yard and street, caused by the clerestories of trees. Pillars of sunlight slip between the leaves. When I go for runs in the mornings I try to catch this, dazzling at the patterns of light that shift with the pace of the wind. I think it is better than any stained-glass window I have ever seen, even the one Matisse designed, which I saw not long ago in a museum. The trees play with the light instead of trying to force its hand.

~

I run the same loop every time I run. It is just around the block but the block is large. The north-south streets are residential and the east-west have farms. When I run along the northernmost street, going from east to west, I pass a small herd of cattle. On quiet days the slapping of my feet on pavement makes them lift their heads. I like to wave at them and smile and then I get to laugh at myself and keep moving. 

~

There’s a cooing noise coming from the attic of the house, especially around dusk and dawn. It’s not quite an owl hoot but some bird I’ve never heard before. There is a large house across the street, not quite as sunken in its plot as ours, and sometimes I hear coos coming from there too. I wonder if there is another bird, buried in their thatched roof, and the two birds in two houses are talking to each other, and I get to eavesdrop.

~

Nighttime is very dark, much darker than I’m used to. I wander around in the front and back of the house in the dark sometimes, when the air tastes different and the insects are louder and larger and I’m sure the slugs come out.

Street lamps are spaced very far apart, maybe so more trees can fit between. The light they produce is incredibly orange and I wonder if it is just the look of old lightbulbs, except that their housings look sleek and modern. Cars bring beams of blue-white light and toss shadows on hedges, houses, horses, and me. I think the sharp white lights passing through vague clouds of dull orange look very cinematic, like out of a story, so here I am writing it.

~

There are two people who I see coming around the house with some regularity: the gardener, and the housekeeper. They have worked here longer than I have been alive, likely more than double even. As I stay longer the house feels more like my fortress: I push furniture around to suit my needs and fill its rooms as much as possible with two suitcases of things. When they come by they tidy, or trim the hedges, or sometimes we chat, neither speaking the other’s language, and my fortress feels porous, but I also feel part of something bigger.

~

The housekeeper, Riek, used to live just down the block, but some time ago she moved into town. I know I visited her at home when I was a child but can’t remember which house it was until finally biking past I see a brick entryway jutting out from the south side and suddenly _that was it_, the house, I remember the awkward entry, and being able to peek through to the kitchen, and the cramped bicameral living room with tall, pointed ceiling, and the housekeeper’s husband offering me candy and the fireplace going too. I don’t know who lives there now.

~

I look up from my laptop screen after a few hours of reading and the horizon is a deep purple, descending into an illuminated oxblood as the sun sets. I didn’t notice until I turned around to stretch my back. Suddenly the couch feels very small and the words on the screen very pointless. The hours have vanished. I’m here to work and read, I tell myself, but the sky disagrees.

~

One evening sitting outside I smell smoke. My first fear is the house coming down and explaining to everyone it was my fault, I had left the stove on, I am so sorry and I’ll never forgive myself, even if the house was going to get razed anyway. But the house is not on fire: the neighbors are having a bonfire. I can see flickers of orange peeking through the thicket at the North end of the yard, and smoke rolling over the cornfields. Little boys shriek with delight. I try to stay hidden behind the shrubs so they won’t see me but I’m not sure why.

~

One of my goals coming here for a month was to get comfortable with alone time. My first few days were antsy, but I quickly find periodic email checks and writing in my diary are really all the conversation I need. The house became my monastery. The countryside is extremely safe but I still had moments of paranoia, believing my solitude shattered when mice scurried around or the wind blew branches into scraping the windows. The most threatening sounds are the acorns falling from the tops of trees, hitting every branch on their way down, sounding like stiff, erratic footsteps.

~

On a cold night I open the armoire in the master bedroom and put on an enormous grey sweater that likely belongs to my grandfather. Before going to bed I stand for a while at the front gate, facing the streetlamp. It’s orange light singed my thoughts and all I can think about is the black sky and what the word was for “gray” is. I know I have to avoid slugs on the path back to the house. 

~

The breeze is warmer than it should be and keeps tempting to blow leaves into my coffee.

~

The slugs themselves are perversely interesting to examine. they are big by my standards―maybe a full centimeter wide and four or five times that long, sometimes more. They are all varying hues of a matte grey, deriving a sheen not from innate coloring but from the layer of oil that covers them at all times. The largest ones have soft sunflower yellow edges, and their undersides have faded orange stripes. Some if the smaller ones are closer to black and have longer probes, and others are reddish, like rancid beef. If you look too quickly they are easy to mistake for leaves and thick twigs, which they intermingle with after storms.

~

On Saturdays I go into town for the market, and sometimes I think I can make it sound like I am not American. 

~

The way the teacups are stacked, I think my grandmother is the only one who would do it so precisely. 

~

Earlier this year I went to New Orleans for the first time. New Orleans, I think, feels right driving in a convertible, top down, no music playing but plenty wafts in through the windows on the humid air. Have a few beers but you you are sober enough to drive. 

From the house though, the proper way to navigate is on a bike, bolt upright, battling just a breeze, always in the direction opposite of your destination. Lean into the wind and when you breathe you can feel bark peeling off the trees.

~

I dream, one night, that I stepped to a frontal window on the second floor and saw a woman, at dawn, wearing all black but with cropped white hair. She was collecting some personal affects as she moved out of the bushes near the front door and stood in the early daylight on the path to the street. I froze, in fear, but my movement caused the floorboards to creak. I don’t think she saw me but her eyes widened and she hurriedly shuffled towards the front gate and then vanished.

The morning after waking up to this dream, when I opened the door to go for a run, a black cat darted out of the bushes and ran almost the same path, squeezing out through a gap near the front gate latch.

~

The air is thick and as I ride my bicycle I turned to look at houses along the road. The sun warms one side of my face and the wind cooly pushes the other like a pillow made of breeze. 

~

Bicycling in humidity is quiet. The air rounds off the harsh edges of most sounds and dampens any echoes. I ride a Gazelle that I think belongs to my grandfather and is probably older than I am. Often when I ride the only noises are the hum of rubber on pavement and the soft clatter of the rickety bell on the handlebars. 

~

In early August I wake up early to meet my friend Alex in Belgium. After a streak of clear, open skies, this morning’s sky is heavy and the fog lies thick, hugging the land. When I get on my bicycle it feels like I pedaling through sludge. All the houses and trees push into the ground under the weight of the sky, the space between them compressed.

~

During the return journey from Antwerp I realize it is the last time I will return to the house by train. All other trips will be done by bike. I wonder what my grandparents’ last return to the house will be like, and I wonder what it was for my great-grandparents. Did they die in the house? Did they like to bicycle or drive or take the train? I still don’t know the type of the trees that line the sides of the roads and I don’t know what year the house was built. It’s dark as my friend and I ride this final train and make the bicycle trip to the house, bumping around on the black paved path, and I can’t figure out how to turn the bicycle light on. 

~

A relative, Egbert, visits and tells me a story from when he was around my age. He went to visit a girl in Germany, taking the trip with a friend by motorcycle. On their way back it got very cold—it was deep in winter—and they tried drinking cognac for warmth as they rode back to the lowlands. But still, it got too cold and too late to make it all the way home. Instead they stopped here, at the house, at two or three in the morning, and my great-grandmother welcomed them in with love. When you light a fire and pull the sliding wooden doors shut, the living room becomes a cozy furnace. They buried themselves in blankets and wine and left the next morning for home. 

He tells me this story and I love it, but I can’t remember my great-grandmother and I forget to ask him for more memories. 

~

I like to sit in the dead center of the biggest expanse of the yard, facing West, away from the house. The ribcage of trees is to the right twenty meters and an empty bench the same on my left. The house vanishes behind me and cornfields fill my thoughts instead. It is a good place to listen to my body instead of my brain. There is a billowing breeze from the North that smells like freshly cut grass and freshly deposited manure, in a warm and sweet way. On clear nights this is the spot with the most beautiful sun and long golden shadows between the trees. Then the sky itself lights up and buries the sun into the earth.

~

When I sit and read in the yard my mind slips and spills over the words. All the sentences end off the pages and find themselves instead with the flowers and birds and deep sky. 

~

As I stay longer, the smell of the house becomes harder to describe. I’m becoming too accustomed to it. When I’m buried in my own thoughts, though, and go up the stairs, or open a door suddenly, or wake up from an accidental nap, it can catch me. Old, wet wood. Starched linens. Dust and dirt and disintegrating upholstery. The house doesn’t have a basement. If it did, it would be underwater or full of slugs. But it means that the soil and moss are right there, sneaking up through the floorboards. 

~

My friend Steve sends me an email that makes me audibly laugh and it feels like the most genuine laugh possible—I’m alone, sitting with a book, and the only other sound is the washing machine sloshing. No sounds echo inside the house but the stone floors make you think they might. 

~

When friends visit, we go to the market and eat too much fish. Then we come home and drink too much wine. I take pleasure in the rebellion of getting drunk in a house I know only from childhood. All of this helps warm the brick-walled rooms that otherwise feel too big and too cold for just one person. 

~

The grass in the yard is dense and peaty, filled with lichens and the shells of fallen nuts. To me it feels like what would grow at the bottom of the ocean, or instead the thick fur of some fast creature with small ecosystems living on its hide. When you walk across it, it remembers your footsteps for a few moments before the spongey biomatter inhales again. 

~

Mumbling unknown words, I pedal into the low-hanging sun. 

~

I’ve fallen into a good routine with the house. I run, I eat simple meals, I read, and I work. But a routine can be too easy to follow, and today I missed the sunset. One moment I was eating dinner and the shadows were long, and then by the time I look up from my book, it’s dark out. I want to see the last sunset here very badly and I hope it doesn’t rain.

~

As I prepare to leave the house I’m washing all of the tablecloths and towels, and for the first time during my stay I see the wooden of the dining room table. It’s beautiful and smooth, with small chips at the edges that I’m sure have stories behind them. There’s a photo, tacked to a cabinet door in the same room, of my aunt and uncle sitting at this exact table as children, which means it was taken almost 60 years ago. The same table for sixty years, and it doesn’t even wobble on the cool stone floor. I want to take it with me, the rich red wood and simple metal hardware and decades of people sitting and eating atop it. But it’s too heavy, to difficult to get across the ocean. Somebody here who speaks the language will get it. 

~

On my last morning in the house I wake up under a new blanket, a freshly cleaned one to leave for the next group of visitors who will pay their respects. One of the last smells of the house catches me: a sap, or syrup perhaps, but syrup sounds too sweet. A that slowly drips out of the wooden marrow joints of an old, enormous creature. And with that sweet sap, I know why the slugs are here.
