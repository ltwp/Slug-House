Paragraphs from the House of Slugs

~

All roads near the house are lined on both sides with trees, bathed in light between the enormous spaces of fields and farm houses. I think they are oaks. The trees are mostly of uniform height, likely planted near the same time a couple generations ago. They only get light on one side, as the opposite side of the road blocks the sun. The trees thus only grow leaves on the outside of the road, and arch high above the enclosed road. As you drive, you feel the sense of a continuous green vaulted ceiling; a cathedral of trees. 

~

When friends visit, we go to the market in the nearby town and eat too much fish. Then we come home and drink too much wine. I take pleasure in the rebellion of getting drunk in a house I only knew from childhood. All of this helps warm the house that otherwise feels too big and too cold for just me when I am alone. 

~

The wind sweeps over the flora, brushing the leaves to flutter over each other and twisting branches into squeaks. The countryside is built of three materials: plant, pavement, and water. Canals snake between the fields, sometimes flanked by narrow roads. When big gusts come rolling over the landscape the fronds at the top of the crop stalks shimmer in waves. The canals catch and carry these solitons far into the distance, and light dances through the foliage on the pavement. The lungs of the countryside exhale.

Mumbling unknown words as I pedal into the sun.

I call my grandmother, an international call so I try to make it fast. She sounds excited to hear my voice, coming from her old house on another continent. I need help turning the stove on and I say I don’t think gas is flowing. There is a knob behind the stove, she says, and she calls the knob heavy. I have never used this word to describe a knob before. The actual thing that I grab to turn the knob is a cheap plastic cap. I think I would have called it sticky, or perhaps gummy. I hate that it is shitty plastic yet still so difficult to rotate, and I think again about why she chose the word heavy. I wonder if everything is heavy when you are 85 and I am afraid of being that old. 

~

On the north end of the yard there is a cluster of extremely tall trees, between which someone hung laundry lines many years ago. Just like on the streets, the trees only grow leaves on the outside of this enclosed space. Standing between and looking up feels like the ribcage of an enormous creature. 

~

When I sit and read in the yard my mind slips and spills over the words. I find all the sentences end off the pages and find themselves instead with the flowers and birds and deep sky. 

~

When I sit outside I like to sit in the dead center of the biggest open expanse of the yard, facing west, away from the house. The ribcage of trees is to my right 20 meters and an empty bench the same on my left. The house vanishes behind me and cornfields fill my thoughts instead. It is a good place to tune into my body instead of my brain. There is a billowing breeze from the north that smells like freshly cut grass and freshly deposited manure, but in the sweetest way. I’m not sure how the wind navigates through the ribcage but it is reaching me just fine. On clear nights this is the spot with the most beautiful sun, long orange shadows between the trees, just before the sky itself lights up and buries the sun into the earth.

~

I’m trying to wake up earlier but instead I keep finding excuses to stay up late. To talk to friends or read books. If I can get up before ten then I can turn to the east and catch the marvelous marbling of light thrown across the front yard and street. it’s all because of the clerestories of trees, and pillars of sunlight where it can slip between the leaves. When I go for runs in the mornings I try to catch this, dazzling at the patterns of light that shift with the pace of the wind. I think it is better than any stained-glass window I have ever seen, even the one Matisse designed that I saw not long ago in a museum. The trees play with the light instead of trying to force its hand.

~

I run the same loop every time I run. It is just around the block but the block is large. The eastern and western streets are residential, the north and south have farms. When I run the northern street, going from east to west, I pass a small herd of cattle and on quiet days the slapping of my feet on pavement makes them lift their heads. I like to wave at them and smile and then I get some a laugh and keep moving. 

~

The surest sign of a still day here in the low countries is finding two adjacent windmills pointed in different directions.

~

In early August I got up early to meet a friend in Belgium. After a streak of clear, open skies, on this morning the sky was heavy and the fog lay thick and hugged the land. When I got on my bicycle it felt like I was pedaling in sludge. All the houses and trees pushed into the ground under the weight of the sky, the space between them compressed.

~

During the return journey from Antwerp I realize it is the last time I will return to the house by train. All else will be done by bike. I wonder what my grandparents’ last return to the house. What was it like for my great-grandparents? Did they die in the house? I still don’t know the type of the trees that line the sides of the roads and I don’t know what year the house was built. It’s dark as my friend and I ride this final train and make the bicycle trip to the house, bumping around on the black paved path, and I can’t figure seem to turn the light on. 

~

Earlier this year I took a trip to New Orleans, my first time. New Orleans, I think, feels right driving in a convertible, top down, no music playing but plenty wafts in through the windows on the humid air. Have a few beers but you you are sober enough to drive. 

From the house though, the proper way to navigate is on a bike, bolt upright, battling just a breeze, always in the direction opposite of your destination. Lean into the wind and when you breathe you can feel bark peeling off the trees.

~

On my ride home today the air was thick and I turned to look at houses along the road. The sun warmed one side of my face and the wind cooly pushed the other. I felt I had found a pillow in the breeze. 

~

When it rains the slugs come out of the ground, through the cracks in the cement and gaps between the stones. They wind their way around the house, masses of greasy, greying flesh. We used to feed them the remainders of cabbage and lettuce when friendly, beer and salt when maleficent, dumping it all out of the window in the kitchen while keeping the door locked tight.

~

I look up from my laptop screen after a few hours of digital reading and the sky is a deep purple, descending into an illuminated oxblood, as the sun sets. I didn’t notice until I turned around to stretch my back. Suddenly the couch feels very small, very pointless. The hours wasted away. I’m here to work and read, I tell myself, but the sky, my gosh. De lucht. 

~

The way the teacups are stacked, I think my grandmother is the only one who can do it so precisely. 

~

As I stay longer, the smell of the house becomes harder to describe. I’m becoming too accustomed to it. When I’m buried in my own thoughts, though, and go up the stairs, or open a door suddenly, or wake up from an accidental nap, it can catch me. Old, wet wood. New, wet soil. Starched linens. Dust and disintegrating upholstery. The house doesn’t have a basement. If it did, it would be underwater. But I think this brings the soil and moss that much closer to the interior rooms. 

~

Once upon waking up early, having dreamt that when I awoke, i stepped to a frontal window on the second floor, and saw a woman, at dawn, wearing sll black but with cropped white hair. she was collecting some personal affects as she moved out of the bushes and stood in the early daylight on thr path by the front door. I froze, in fear, but moved and hit the glass of the window. i fon’t think she saw me but her eyes widened and she hurriedly shuffled towards the front gate and then vanished.

The morning after waking up to this memory, when I opened the door to go for a run, a black cat darted out of the bushes and ran in almost the same path, squeezing out through a gap near the gate.

~

There are two people who I see coming atound the house with some regularity: the gardener, and the housekeeper. They have worked here longer than I have been alive, likely more than double even. When I am alone the house feels like my fortress. I have pushed ffurniture atound to suit my needs and have filled its rooms as much as I can with my two suitcases of things. When they come by and drift in and around, the house feels porous, but I also feel part of something bigger.

~

the housekeeper used to live just down the block but now moved into the nearest town. i know that i visited her and her husband when I was a child but couldn’t remember which house it was until biking past one morning. i saw a brick entryway that juts out from the south side of the house and suddenly _that was it_, i remember the awkward entry, and peeking all the way through to the kitchen, and the cramped bicameral living room with tall, pointed ceiling, and the housekeeper’s husband offering me candy and perhaps the fireplace is going. I don’t know who lives there now.

~

At the grocery store today I think I got away with not sounding like an American. 

~

for lack of much better to do i went for a bike ride around the closest town, hoping to see some of its corners that i had yet to explore. i went through it west, and pedaled up a rare hill to cross some railroad tracks, dairy farms on both sides of the road. the fields were huge. i’m a city boy and to see such open spaces still takes my breath away.

i have less than a week left of my month here now. on my way back the road folded into some woods, bringing the expansive sky and pastures with it. i feel like i will do the same as I fly back to the east coast of the US. take these huge natural spaces and pack them away into the back of my head, to be recollected when in need of a break from height and density and noise and heat.

~

i smelled smoke, like from a campfire, while sitting outside. my first fear was the house was coming down and i would have to explain to everyone that it was my fault, i left the stove on, i am so sorry and i’ll never forgive myself, even if the house was going to get razed anyway. but the house was not on fire: the neighbors were having a bonfire. i could see flickers of orange peeking through the thicket at the end of the yard, and smoke rolling over the cornfields, and little boys shreiked with delight. i tried to stay hidden behind the shrubs so they wouldn’t see me but I’m not sure why.

~

I’ve fallen into a good routine with the house. I run, and I eat little meals, and I read, and I work. But a routine can be too easy to follow, and today I missed the sunset. One moment I was eating dinner and the shadows were long, and then by the time I look up from my book, it’s dark out. I want to see the last sunset here very badly and I hope it doesn’t rain.

~

The slugs themselves are perversely interesting to examine. they are big by my standards―maybe a full centimeter wide and four or five times that long. They are all varying hues of a matte grey, deriving a sheen not from innate coloring but from the layer of oil that covers them at all times. The largest ones have soft sunflower yellow edges, and their underside has faded orange stripes. Some if the smaller ones are closer to black and have longer probes, and others are reddish, like rancid beef. If you move too quickly they are easy to mistake for leaves and thick twigs, which they intermingle with after storms.

~

The breeze is warmer than it should be and keeps tempting to blow leaves into my coffee.

~

nighttime is very dark, much darker than I’m used to. I wander around in the front and back of the house in the dark sometimes, when the air tastes different and the insects are louder and larger.

the streetlamps are pulled far from one another, with plenty of tall trees in-between. the light they produce is incredibly orange and I wonder if that is just the look of old lamps, except that they look sleek and modern. cars, with their bright white and blue headlamps, are passing spheres of shadows tossed on hedges, houses, horses, and me. I think the sharp white lights passing through vague clouds of dull orange looks very cinematic and that it’s out of a story, so here i am writing it.

~

one of my goals coming here for a month was to get comfortable with alone time. back in the states i am always bouncing between friends and family and coworkers, so i was curious what extended time alone would feel like. three friends have visited so the longest true period of time alone was 7 days.

i was very antsy for a couple days but quickly found that a periodic email check and writing in my diary was really all the conversation i needed. the house became my solitary fortress. the countryside is extremely safe but i had moments of paranoia of people around when mice scurried around or the wind blew branches into scraping the windows. the most threatening sounds are the acorns that fall from the tops of trees, hitting every branch on their way down, sounding like stiff, erratic footsteps.

A distant relative visits and tells me a story from when he was around my age. He was seeing a girl from Germany and he and his friend drove motorcycles to visit her. On their way back it got very cold—it was deep in winter—and they tried drinking cognac for warmth as they rode back to the lowlands. They got too cold and it got too late to get all the way home so they stopped at the house here, *De Schuur,* at 2 or 3 in the morning for respite. And my great-grandmother welcomed them in with love, giving them blankets and a warm fireplace. When you pull the sliding wooden doors shut, the living room becomes a cozy furnace. They buried themselves in blankets and wine and the next morning made it home. 

~

There’s a cooing noise that comes from the attic of the house, especially during dusk and dawn. It’s not quite an owl hoot but a bird I’ve never heard before. There is a large house across the street, not quite as sunken in its plot as ours, and sometimes I hear coos coming from there too. I wonder if there is another bird, buried in their thatched roof, and the two birds, two houses, are talking to each other.
