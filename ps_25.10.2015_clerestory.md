Paragraphs from the House of Slugs

~

When it rains the slugs come out of the ground, through the cracks in the cement and gaps between the cool stones. They wind their way around the house, masses of greasy, greying flesh. When I was young we fed them the remainders of cabbage and lettuce when friendly, beer and salt when maleficent, dumping scraps out of the kitchen window while keeping the door locked tight.

I call my Oma. Her voice echoes warmth through her house on another continent. I need help turning the stove on and I don’t think gas is flowing. There is a knob behind the stove, she says, and she calls the knob heavy. I have never used this word to describe a knob before. It is a flimsy plastic cap yet still difficult to rotate, and I think again about why she chose the word heavy. I wonder if everything is heavy when you are 85 and I am afraid of being old in a heavy house.

I go for a bike ride around the closest town, hoping to find leftover memories or at least to unravel my head. I pedal westward and up a small hill, quiet dairy farms in all directions. The fields are dotted with cows, flanked on their sides by thick trees and from above by a wrap-around sky. Dense homes and dense towns are wedged between green expanses and whatever I was thinking about has been forgotten.

As I stay longer, the smell of the house becomes harder to describe. When I’m buried in my own thoughts, though, it creeps in through rattan mats and timber framing. Old, wet wood. Starched linens. Dust and dirt and disintegrating upholstery. The house doesn’t have a basement. If it did, it would be underwater or full of slugs. But it doesn’t: the soil and moss are right there, sneaking up through the thick floorboards.

On the north end of the yard there is a tall cluster of trees, between which hang laundry lines that were nailed in the year I was born. When I hang my wet clothes I stand between the trees and watch the muddled light dance inside the wooden ribcage of an enormous creature, ready to exhale.

On a cold night I open the armoire in the master bedroom and put on an grey sweater. It likely belonged to my grandfather but now sits folded and full of holes. Before going to bed I stand for a while at the front gate, facing a streetlight whose orange light singes my thoughts and all I can think about is the black sky and the word “grey”. I know I have to avoid stepping on slugs on the path back to the house and a slight breeze slips though the long sleeves of the knit.

On an early morning in August, I set off to catch a train to Belgium. After a streak of clear, open skies, this morning’s is heavy and the fog lies thick, hugging the land. When I get on my bicycle I’m pedaling through sludge. The sky flattens the houses and trees, weighing them further into the ground and the landscape is flat, flat, flat.

On my last morning in the house one of the most delicate smells of the house catches me: a sap, or syrup perhaps, but syrup sounds too sweet. A sap that slowly drips out of the marrowed joints of an old, lumbering animal. And with that sweet sap, I know why the slugs are here.
