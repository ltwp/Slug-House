Paragraphs from the House of Slugs

~

All roads near the house are lined on both sides with trees, bathed in light between the enormous spaces of fields and farm houses. I think they are oaks. The trees are mostly of uniform height, likely planted near the same time a couple generations ago. They only get light on one side, as the opposite side of the road blocks the sun. The trees thus only grow leaves on the outside of the road, and arch high above the enclosed road. As you drive, you feel the sense of a continuous green vaulted ceiling; a cathedral of trees.

When friends visit, we go to the market in the nearby town and eat too much fish. Then we come home and drink too much wine. I take pleasure in the rebellion of getting drunk in a house I only knew from childhood. All of this helps warm the house that otherwise feels too big and too cold for just me when I am alone.

The wind sweeps over the flora, brushing the leaves to flutter over each other and twisting branches into squeaks. The countryside is built of three materials: plant, pavement, and water. Canals snake between the fields, sometimes flanked by narrow roads. When big gusts come rolling over the landscape the fronds at the top of the crop stalks shimmer in waves. The canals catch and carry these solitons far into the distance, and light dances through the foliage on the pavement. The lungs of the countryside exhale.

Mumbling unknown words as I pedal into the sun.

I call my grandmother, an international call so I try to make it fast. She sounds excited to hear my voice, coming from her old house on another continent. I need help turning the stove on and I say I don’t think gas is flowing. There is a knob behind the stove, she says, and she calls the knob heavy. I have never used this word to describe a knob before. The actual thing that I grab to turn the knob is a cheap plastic cap. I think I would have called it sticky, or perhaps gummy. I hate that it is shitty plastic yet still so difficult to rotate, and I think again about why she chose the word heavy. I wonder if everything is heavy when you are 85 and I am afraid of being that old.

On the north end of the yard there is a cluster of extremely tall trees, between which someone hung laundry lines many years ago. Just like on the streets, the trees only grow leaves on the outside of this enclosed space. Standing between and looking up feels like the ribcage of an enormous creature. 

~

When I sit and read in the yard my mind slips and spills over the words. I find all the sentences end off the pages and find themselves instead with the flowers and birds and deep sky. 

~

When I sit outside I like to sit in the dead center of the biggest open expanse of the yard, facing west, away from the house. The ribcage of trees is to my right 20 meters and an empty bench the same on my left. The house vanishes behind me and cornfields fill my thoughts instead. It is a good place to tune into my body instead of my brain. There is a billowing breeze from the north that smells like freshly cut grass and freshly deposited manure, but in the sweetest way. I’m not sure how the wind navigates through the ribcage but it is reaching me just fine. On clear nights this is the spot with the most beautiful sun, long orange shadows between the trees, just before the sky itself lights up and buries the sun into the earth.

I’m trying to wake up earlier but instead I keep finding excuses to stay up late. To talk to friends or read books. If I can get up before ten then I can turn to the east and catch the marvelous marbling of light thrown across the front yard and street. it’s all because of the clerestories of trees, and pillars of sunlight where it can slip between the leaves. When I go for runs in the mornings I try to catch this, dazzling at the patterns of light that shift with the pace of the wind. I think it is better than any stained-glass window I have ever seen, even the one Matisse designed that I saw not long ago in a museum. The trees play with the light instead of trying to force its hand.

I run the same loop every time I run. It is just around the block but the block is large. The eastern and western streets are residential, the north and south have farms. When I run the northern street, going from east to west, I pass a small herd of cattle and on quiet days the slapping of my feet on pavement makes them lift their heads. I like to wave at them and smile and then I get some a laugh and keep moving.

The surest sign of a still day here in the low countries is finding two adjacent windmills pointed in different directions.

In early August I got up early to meet a friend in Belgium. After a streak of clear, open skies, on this morning the sky was heavy and the fog lay thick and hugged the land. When I got on my bicycle it felt like I was pedaling in sludge. All the houses and trees pushed into the ground under the weight of the sky, the space between them compressed.

~

During the return journey from Antwerp I realize it is the last time I will return to the house by train. All else will be done by bike. I wonder what my grandparents’ last return to the house. What was it like for my great-grandparents? Did they die in the house? I still don’t know the type of the trees that line the sides of the roads and I don’t know what year the house was built. It’s dark as my friend and I ride this final train and make the bicycle trip to the house, bumping around on the black paved path, and I can’t figure seem to turn the light on.

Earlier this year I took a trip to New Orleans, my first time. New Orleans, I think, feels right driving in a convertible, top down, no music playing but plenty wafts in through the windows on the humid air. Have a few beers but you you are sober enough to drive. 

From the house though, the proper way to navigate is on a bike, bolt upright, battling just a breeze, always in the direction opposite of your destination. Lean into the wind and when you breathe you can feel bark peeling off the trees.

On my ride home today the air was thick and I turned to look at houses along the road. The sun warmed one side of my face and the wind cooly pushed the other. I felt I had found a pillow in the breeze.

When it rains the slugs come out of the ground, through the cracks in the cement and gaps between the stones. They wind their way around the house, masses of greasy, greying flesh. We used to feed them the remainders of cabbage and lettuce when friendly, beer and salt when maleficent, dumping it all out of the window in the kitchen while keeping the door locked tight.
